<title>Niamh Crisp O'Brien </title>

<p>Niamh is an award-winning youth activist based in the heart of Surrey. She spends her time talking to MPs, writing draft policy and meeting her constituents. </p>
  <br>
<p>Outside of her youth work, she enjoys getting out in the Surrey Hills, going to concerts and being gluten-free. Niamh is currently in her first year at Godalming College, studying A-Levels in something boring, something fun, and 2 langauges if I can remember correctly. </p>
